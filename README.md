# 100 Days of Code - Python

Welcome to my journey of practicing 100 Days of Code in Python, inspired by Angela Yu's course. This repository will document my progress, projects, and the concepts I learn along the way.

## Concepts Covered

Throughout this course, I will be learning and practicing the following concepts:

- Web Scraping (Selenium)
- Data Science
- Python Scripting
- Web Development
- GUI Development
- Web Design
- API
- Automation
- Game Development
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Projects

Here are some of the exciting projects I will be working on:

1. **Automating Job Applications on LinkedIn**
2. **Automated Amazon Price Tracker**
3. **Tinder Swiping Bot**

## Daily Progress

I will be updating this section with my daily progress, including the challenges I face and the solutions I find.

### Day 1: [12-08-2024]
- **Concepts Learned**:
  - Creating the Python Variables and printing them.
  - Taking input from the user.
  - String Manipulation
- **Project Worked On**:
  - Band Name Generator
- **Challenges**:
  - Differentiating between data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
  - Choosing appropriate and meaningful variable names.
  - Encountered syntax, indentation, and type errors when doing string manipulation.
- **Solutions**: 
  - Practice creating variables of different types and using the type() function to check their types.
  - Follow naming conventions like using lowercase letters and underscores.
  - Carefully read error messages and debug step by step. Practice writing clean and well-indented code.
### Day 2: [13-08-2024]
- **Concepts Learned**:
  - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings
  - Type Error, Type Checking, and Type Conversion
  - Number Manipulation and F Strings
- **Project Worked On**:
  - BMI Calculator
  - Tip Calculator
- **Challenges**:
  - Misunderstanding how to calculate the tip percentage correctly.
  - Handling Arithmetic Exception(Dividing a number by zero)
  - Got unexpected results when converting the types.
- **Solutions**: 
  - Tried to add the percentage directly to the bill amount instead of calculating the percentage of the bill.
  - Using the choice function in the random module to generate random values from the list.
### Day 3: [14-08-2024]
- **Concepts Learned**:
  - Control Flow and Logical Operators
  - Type Error, Type Checking, and Type Conversion
  - Number Manipulation and F Strings
- **Project Worked On**:
  - BMI Calculator with Interpretations
  - Treasure Island
- **Challenges**:
  - Grasping how if, elif, and else statements work.
  - Understanding the difference between for and while loops and knowing when to use each.
  - Working with lists, including indexing, slicing, and list comprehension.
- **Solutions**: 
  - Practice writing simple conditional statements and gradually increase complexity.
  - Write small programs that use both for and while loops.
  - Practice creating, modifying, and iterating over lists.
  - Using the choice function in the random module to generate random values from the list.

### Day 4: [15-08-2024]
